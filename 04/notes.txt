Remember: List the commands in a SELECT statement.

SELECT statements have the following format:

    SELECT <column1, column2, ... *>
    FROM <table1, table2 ...>
    <optional: WHERE <condition>>

comparison operators: <, >, <=, >=, != and =

<> is like !=

SQL uses a single = symbol to mean equal to instead of ==. can be used on both strings and numbers
in case of strings both case and characters need to be the same for the two strings to be equal
"Numero Uno" != "NuMer0 Uno"

strings have additional operators : LIKE in the WHERE clause:

SELECT title
FROM books
WHERE title LIKE '%Bartholomew%';
