1. List the commands for adding, updating, and deleting data:

adding : INSERT INTO
ex:
  INSERT INTO products VALUES (11773, 'South Face Jacket', 174.99);

updating : UPDATE
ex:
  UPDATE products SET price=159.99 WHERE id=11773;

deleting: DELETE FROM
ex:

DELETE FROM products WHERE id=11776;

2. explain the structure for each type of command:

CREATE TABLE:

instructs to create a table in the current database. each column a statement provides a name and a data type.

ex:

  CREATE TABLE products (
      id integer,
      name text,
      price numeric(5, 2)
  );


INSERT INTO: populates table with values. we define a set of rows that
will be inserted into the table

ex INSERT INTO products VALUES (11773, 'South Face Jacket', 174.99);

single row insertion. INSERT INTO is the command, and we choose the table (products). adding VALUES will define what values are being added into the table.
values need to be laid out correctly in the columns they appear in the table.

multiple row:

INSERT INTO products (id, name, price)
VALUES
(11773, 'South Face Jacket', 174.99),
(11774, 'Big Mountain 2-Person Tent', 219.99),
(11775, 'King Cole Camp Stove', 34.99),
(11776, 'Oregon Trail Mountain Bike', 579.99);


UPDATE: UPDATE can be used with SET and WHERE to change data. we define what table being updated after UPDATE then use SET
to change the data. the row can be found using WHERE.

ex:

UPDATE products SET price=159.99 WHERE id=11773;



DELETE: removes data. used with FROM to target table and WHERE to find row.

ex: DELETE FROM products WHERE id=11776;

ALTER TABLE: can be used to change table's schema.

ex:
adding column:
ALTER TABLE products ADD COLUMN description text;
removing column:
ALTER TABLE products DROP COLUMN description;


3. What are some the data types that can be used in tables?
Give a real world example of each.

some data types that can be used in tables are serials, numeric, text, and dates

real world exp for these three would be a database of items in a retail store.
A table would be products and the table can consist of upc (serial) item name (text) price (numeric) and date added (date).
There definitely can be more data to a product list like in store (boolean), item location(serial) on the floor (int) in the backroom (int).

4. Think through how to create a new table to hold a list of people invited to a wedding. This table needs to have first and last name, whether they sent in their RSVP, the number of guests they are bringing, and the number of meals (1 for adults and 1/2 for children).

First and last name: text.
Sent RSVP: boolean: its a yes or no
number of guests: int
number of meals: numeric

create table:

CREATE TABLE invitations (
    name text,
    RSVP boolean,
    guests integer,
    meals numeric
);

Adds a column to track if they were sent a thank you card:

ALTER TABLE invitations ADD COLUMN 'Thank You Card' boolean;

Removing data about meals:

ALTER TABLE invitations DROP COLUMN meals;

Adding table number:

ALTER TABLE invitations ADD COLUMN table integer;

Deleting table:

DROP TABLE invitations;


5. Write a command to make a new table to hold the books in a library with the columns ISBN, title, author, genre, publishing date, number of copies, and available copies.

CREATE TABLE library (
    ISBN_13 char,
    title text,
    author text,
    genre text,
    publishing_date date,
    copies integer,
    available_copies integer
);

#find three books and add their info to the table:

INSERT INTO library (ISBN-13, title, author, genre, publishing_date, copies, available_copies)
VALUES
  (978-1328869333, '1984', 'George Orwell', 'Fiction', 06/08/1949, 5, 5),
  (978-0140268867, 'The Odyssey', 'Deckle Edge', 'Poetry', 11/01/1997 6, 6),
  (978-0582275225, 'Brave New World', 'Aldous Huxley', 'Fiction', 01/01/1932 9, 9);


someone just checked out one of the boots. Change the available copies column to 1 fewer:

UPDATE library SET available_copies=4 WHERE ISBN_13=978-1328869333;

banned book

DELETE FROM library WHERE ISBN_13=978-0140268867;


6.Write a command to make a new table to hold spacecrafts. Information should include id, name, year launched, country of origin, a brief description of the mission, orbiting body, if it is currently operating, and approximate miles from Earth. In addition to the table creation, provide commands that perform the following operations:

CREATE TABLE spacecrafts (
    id integer,
    name text,
    year_launched integer,
    country_of_origin text,
    mission_description text,
    orbiting_body text,
    operating boolean,
    miles_from_earth integer
);

INSERT INTO spacecrafts (id, name, year_launched, country_of_origin, mission_description, orbiting_body, operating, miles_from_earth)
    VALUES
    (1, 'Akatsuki', 2010, 'Japan', 'First Japanese Venusian probe', 'Venus', TRUE, 162000000),
    (2, 'MAVEN', 2013, 'US', 'Study the martian upper atmosphere and it's gradual loss to space', 'Mars', TRUE, 33900000),
    (3, 'Juno', 2016, 'US', 'studying Jupiter from polar orbit', 'Jupiter', TRUE, 365000000 );

DELETE FROM spacecrafts WHERE id=2
UPDATE spacecrafts SET operating=FALSE WHERE id=3


CREATE TABLE inbox (
    id integer,
    subject_line text,
    sender text,
    addtional_recipients text,
    body text,
    date CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    read boolean,
    id_chain integer
);

INSERT INTO inbox (id, subject_line, sender, addtional_recipients, body, date, read, id_chain)
    VALUES
    (1, 'New Meeting Date' 'Jimmy Doe', 'James Lu' 'Hey we have a change in the meeting date. Please confirm the new calendar event', 00:00:01, TRUE, 3 ),
    (2, 'New Friend Request' 'Friend Space', '' 'You have a new friend request! James Lu', 10:00:01, FALSE, 5 ),
    (3, 'Your credit score has been updated' 'John Cienna', '' 'Your credit score has changed. Login to find out what has changed!', 13:00:01, TRUE, 7 );

    DELETE FROM inbox WHERE id=2;
    UPDATE inbox SET read=FALSE WHERE id=1;
